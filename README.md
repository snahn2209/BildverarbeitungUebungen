# BildverarbeitungUebungen
= Image Processing course at HTW Berlin
The course 'Bildverarbeitung' was all about image processing, image manipulation with filters, geometric image transformations, morphological filters, statistical signal sizes and image compression.

These were tasks given by Prof. Dr. Klaus Jung as part of the course.
The templates were written by Prof. Dr. Jung, but all TODOs were done by me.
